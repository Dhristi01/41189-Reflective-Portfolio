# Week 1 – Complex Adaptive Systems and Complexity in Social Worlds

## •	What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt about systems and its distinct characteristics and boundaries. I learnt how systems changed from complicated to complex and its many examples. I also learnt about the elements and parts systems are made of.

## •	What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?

I now know the difference between the various systems such as systems, complex adaptive systems. I also discovered that systems can be classified into various categories and can analyse its complexities.

## •	What insights have I gained?

It was fascinating to see howe systems can transform from simple to complicated to complex by just adding another element. How elements are joined to form systems and perform given tasks such as Artificial Intelligence.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have encountered that I really enjoy learning about systems and have developed a thorough understanding of it after the lecture. I have realised that differentiating between elements and systems could a little bit difficult than I previously thought as it must be analysed well.

## •	What were the challenges that I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

There were no challenges encountered in this lesson.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I would try to keep an open and innovative mind for the next learning content to better understand the logic and reasoning.

## •	What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

This is not a specific theory but an explanation by one of the facilitators who said that individual parts cannot create movement on their own but when joined create movement. I find this explanation simple and easy to understand.

# Week 2 – Understanding Complex Adaptive Systems: Many Model Thinking

## •	What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt what models are, types of models and how we can use them. Our concept of reality is based on models from which I learnt the reasons why models are created and how it helps to understand the concepts of reality.

## •	What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?

Now I know the uses of the models especially the many model thinking with the use of REDCAPE, that is, Reason, Explain, Design, Communicate, Act, Predict and Explore. As a result, this seems to provide a thorough understanding and guidance about modelling.

## •	What insights have I gained?

I have gained insights about how models provide a perspective on various situations and produces wisdom.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have realised that my strength this week was being able to understand the Wisdom Hierarchy especially the ability to identify data, information, and knowledge.

## •	What were the challenges that I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

There was not any major challenge that I encountered this week, but I did face difficulties in perceiving the context of accepting one to many and many to one mindset.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I would like to do more research on certain aspects of modelling to better comprehend and accept the mindset and approach of modelling.

## •	What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The Condorcet Jury Theorem seems to be useful, however, it must be understood properly to properly analysis and use.


# Week 3:  A Supermarket of Models

## •	What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt about Modelling People which is further classified into Rational, Behavioural and Rule-Based. I also grasped the concept of signalling model and how it is used to identify conditions and reveal information, such as, the cost of signalling theory.

## •	What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?

I got to know about the Shapley Value which satisfies the conditions of efficiency, fairness/symmetry, additivity and zero property. It is also applied to cooperativeness such as working as a team. In summation, Shapley Value is a measure of added value.

•	What insights have I gained?

I have gained insights on the idea of modelling as now it could be used in decision making and further make predictions based on previous analysis of collected data.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

The strengths that I have perceived in this lesson is about problem solving through individual and teamwork, respectively. I have realised that a person’s perspective can make a huge difference to a situation which I believe is a strength. As for weakness, I believe that predictions could get a little vague if not perceived precisely.

## •	What were the challenges that I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I do not think I have encountered any major challenges this week.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I think I have fairly grasped the some of the major concepts, however, working on small details could create a vast difference.

## •	What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The theory of Shapley Value is very useful as it is a measure of added value. This can adversely affect an individual’s life depending on how it is applied to the situation. Thus, this theory must be used wisely for accurate results.


# Week 4: Representing Human-Centered Complex Systems

## •	What have I learnt this week?

I have learnt about the concept called System Dynamic this week. This is a model that analyses systems with feedbacks and interdependencies. I have learnt this model includes positive and negative outlooks and can often cause complexity.

## •	What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?

I do know now that System Dynamics model could be applied to real life scenarios as well. A good example is of Covid-19 where this model could be used to predict the possible outcome.

## •	What insights have I gained?

I have gained insights about System Dynamics model as to how it could be useful, however, when compared to agent-based model, it faces shortcomings.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My strengths this week include my ability to grasp the concepts of different models taught each week and relate to the real-life scenarios as a means of visualising the content.

## •	What were the challenges that I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The challenge that I faced this week was not being able to understand the network aspects of models.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I would like to work on the network aspects of models to improve my comprehension of it.

## •	What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

I believe that agent-based model makes more sense and is realistic compared to system dynamics as I was able to relate agent=based accurately to real-life events such as Covid-19.

# Week 5: Aggregating decisions and behaviour

## •	What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt that aggregation of an action allows us to predict and understand data, comprehend complicated patterns and work through logic. I also learnt that probability and distribution is not only about guessing outcomes of coins and dice but interpreting the random occurrence in our lives too.

## •	What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?

I know now that statistics is observable as it can be inferred with real-life parameters to better understand it and guess how real-life data behaves.

## •	What insights have I gained?

The insights that I have gained is about how fascinating probability is. As till now, I had assumed it was just about random numbers and samples but after this lecture, I have realised it more value to it than assumed.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

The strength I encountered this week was that I found the lessons to be simple, understandable, and relevant. Thus, it had encouraged me to pay close attention to detail.

## •	What were the challenges that I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One of the challenges I encountered this week was communicating with our group members as were not familiar with each other, hence had awkwardness.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I would like us to strengthen our team bonding and focus on our communication skills to get started on the project as soon as possible to get efficient results.

## •	What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The theory of aggregation seems to be useful and comprehensible to me as I believe that being able to predict, understand and work out logic is commendable and more so when it is relatable to the real world.

# Week 6: How complex systems evolve in time

## •	What have I learnt this week?

This week I have learnt about the Markov processes and path dependence which is said to be the outcome probabilities depending on the past outcomes.

## •	What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?

I do know now that Random walk model could be used for business decision and related events such as predicting the stock market.

## •	What insights have I gained?

I have gained insights that models play a key role in communication, information systems, marketing, and epidemiology. I have also gathered insight for the Granovetter’s Riot Model which shows the difficulty of predicting social movements.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My strengths perceived this week includes understanding the subject matter. On the other hand, my weakness has been that I have been lethargic and procrastinating my group project which is no good at all.

## •	What were the challenges that I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One of the challenges is that I have been procrastinating a lot to collect information regarding our group assignment.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I would like to change the above challenge/weakness by making progress and coming up with an idea to start at the very least.

## •	What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Granovetter theory seems to be very useful as it helps to lower barriers to entry. I believe this is a good theory to use in team bonding activities to ease uneasiness and get along quickly and efficiently.

# Week 7: Complexity and emergent behaviour (Part 1)

## •	What have I learnt this week?

This week I have learnt more about the Granovetter model alongside segregation and peer effects. Segregation pattern/model uses Schelling, Granovetter and Standing Ovation models to separate or categorise people into different groups to understand their rational behaviour.

## •	What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?

I do know now that the Schelling model is when people with similar likes and dislikes still end up being segregated.

## 	What insights have I gained?

I have gained insights on how to these models and patterns could be developed and used to relate to the real- world scenarios.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

The weakness that I have perceived this week was my inability to make any major progress in relation to our group assignment.

## •	What were the challenges that I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One of the challenges was to select a topic out of the given ones, however, we were able to select one and get our parts assigned to us to get a start for our project.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I would like to take an initiative and help our group members to get as much done as possible and as quickly as we can.

## •	What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The Segregation model seems to be useful and interesting as even though people could share common interests, they would still end up being separated and categorised into groups because of the Schelling model.

# Week 8: Complexity and emergent behaviour (Part 2)

## •	What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt about the Colonel Blotto Game and the Prisoners’ Dilemma which had been one of the best contents I have come across in this subject. The dilemma is between two players who get a supposedly get a payoff when cooperated and a payoff again when defected except for a slight increase or decrease in the payoff.

## •	What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?

I do know now that the prisoners’ dilemma is rather interesting, however, it is also a weak alternation if played repeatedly or multiple times.

## •	What insights have I gained?

The insights that I have gained this week is that the prisoners’ dilemma may not be a good idea collectively when compared to individually as the key theme of getting defected is rather weak.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

One of the perceived strengths for this week is that we were able to get first part of our assignment complete and submitted. On the flip side, we were not well versed with JupyterLab, thus our assignment had to formatted into a pdf file.

## •	What were the challenges that I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

A challenge that I have encountered is not being able to get the procedure for JupyterLab right which has hindered my performance in our group.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I would like to work on my time management skills and get the acquainted with JupyterLab to be able to work on it and assist my team members.

## •	What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The Colonel Blotto game seems to be useful as it can be used for any given scenario when compared to the prisoners’ dilemma.

# Week 9: Group Work

## •	What have I learnt this week?

This week we were more focused on our group assignments, hence, no new topics were covered.

## •	What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?

I do know now how to get to the first step of the JupyterLab which is on the downside is a little time consuming.

## •	What insights have I gained?

As an insight we were able to get feedback on our group assignment from our peers.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

A strength that I have perceived is that I was finally able to get started with JupyterLab and have been eager to work on the next step to get started on the next part of our group assignment.

## •	What were the challenges that I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

A challenge that our team observed was with the next step of the JupyterLab as we had already installed the software and had no clue about the next process. However, after a group meeting, we were back on track and had gotten a fair idea on what was to be done.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I would like to get started with the next part of the assignment as soon as possible and have more communication with our group to be on the same page as them.

# Week 10: Group Work

## •	What have I learnt this week?

I learnt more about the feedback provided to us by our fellow peers which included correcting spelling and grammar and using more concise words.

## •	What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?

After a quick group call, I was able to solve the getting to the bottom of the working with JupyterLab which was a huge relief on my part.

## •	What insights have I gained?

I have gained insights on what is expected of me as part of the assignment.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My strength this week that I have perceived was being able to get JupyterLab working alongside GitHub, thanks to our group leader for persevering with us and making tremendous efforts.

## •	What were the challenges that I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

A challenge faced this week was that we had timing issues in our team as some members were not available all the time, which slightly hindered our progress but we managed to allocate a timetable to get things down.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I would like to be prepared for the next workshop as discussed in our team to get familiar with concept expected.

# Week 11: Group Work

## •	What have I learnt this week?

I have learnt that our tutor had extended our assignment deadline after conducting a quick poll which would now give us ample time to get things done.

## •	What insights have I gained?

I have finally gotten a hang of working in JupyterLab and GitHub simultaneously and have understood the basic process of using it.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

The strengths that I have perceived is that we have been able to delegate parts of our assignment and agreed to help each other out and communicate as much as we can. I believe that we have managed to develop a good repot in our team.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I would like to be prepared with my results for next group meeting/call with our tutor.
