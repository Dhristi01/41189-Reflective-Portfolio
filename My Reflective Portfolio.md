# Week 1 – Complex Adaptive Systems and Complexity in Social Worlds

## •	What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt about systems and its distinct characteristics and boundaries. I learnt how systems changed from complicated to complex and its many examples. I also learnt about the elements and parts systems are made of.

## •	What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?

I now know the difference between the various systems such as systems, complex adaptive systems. I also discovered that systems can be classified into various categories and can analyse its complexities.

## •	What insights have I gained?

It was fascinating to see howe systems can transform from simple to complicated to complex by just adding another element. How elements are joined to form systems and perform given tasks such as Artificial Intelligence.

## •	What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have encountered that I really enjoy learning about systems and have developed a thorough understanding of it after the lecture. I have realised that differentiating between elements and systems could a little bit difficult than I previously thought as it must be analysed well.

## •	What were the challenges that I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

There were no challenges encountered in this lesson.

## •	What would I better do next time and with anticipated results?

I would try to keep an open and innovative mind for the next learning content to better understand the logic and reasoning.

## •	What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

This is not a specific theory but an explanation by one of the facilitators who said that individual parts cannot create movement on their own but when joined create movement. I find this explanation simple and easy to understand.
